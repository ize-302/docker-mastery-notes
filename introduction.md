# Introduction

Docker is made up of 3 innovations:

- Docker image AKA Container image (Build)
  :: Used for building images
- Docker registry (Ship)
  :: Used for application distribution e.g Dockerhub
- Docker container (Run)

### Why containers exist today?

- Better isolation in a single OS
- Reduced environmental variances
- Increasing the speed of change. Speed of business to develop, build, test, and ship faster
